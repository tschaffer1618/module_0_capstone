## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  A method is used to create a block of code that can be used many times in a program.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

  `def hello()`

      `puts "Sam I am"`

  `end`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

  `def hello_someone(name)`

      `puts "#{name} I am"`

  `end`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  `hello_someone(Tyler)`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  At this point, I don't know how much I don't know. This exercise made sense, although using `return` is a little fuzzy to me still.
