## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

    A conditional statement is a statement that is true or false
    1. `25 >= 10`
    2. `"yes" == "yes" && 4 < 9`
    3. `6 < 0 || 4 == 5`

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

    Conditional statements allow the code to perform different actions for different user inputs.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

    `if variable ==/</>/<=/>= some value`
      `puts "Some string"`
    `end`

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

    Use `elsif` for conditions 2 and up; use `else` to cover everything else

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

    `if variable == some value`
      `puts "Some string"`
    `elsif variable == some other value`
      `puts "Some other string"`
    `else`
      `puts "Something else"`
    `end`

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

    Maybe using statements with when or unless
