## Array Methods

1. The `.sort` method rearranges the array in a specific manner (for example, an array of strings will be alphabetized)

1. The `.last` method calls the final element in the array

1. The `.first` method calls the initial element in the array

1. The `.join` method turns the array into a string, inserting the argument between each member of the array as it does so

1. The `.index` method with an argument returns the position of the argument in the array (or nil if the argument is not found)

1. The `.include?` method followed by an argument checks whether that argument is a member of the array

1. The `.each` method (`.each { |list| block }`) pulls every listed member of the array and applies the specified block

1. The `.collect` method is similar to `.each`, but returns an array with the specified block changes

1. The `.shuffle` method rearranges the members of an array in a random order
